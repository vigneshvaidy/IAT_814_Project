The avalanche occurred on a relatively small slope in an open glade at treeline elevation with an incline of about 35 degrees. The avalanche was approximately 150 m wide by 150 m long.



The survivors and other users in the area noticed an avalanche crown with signs of human involvement and the party was reported missing late on December 28, but darkness prevented SAR operations that day. The following morning, RCMP and SAR teams using transceivers and rescue dogs located the two subjects buried about 50-100 cm below the surface in a terrain trap.",Railroad Pass,BC,50.594472,-123.008611,1650,Snow Biking,2,0,2,December,-6

Skies broke and temperatures cooled on the morning of November 28th and SW winds strong enough to move new snow were recorded in the region. 

Two snowmobilers were riding in the Bijou Falls riding area towards the east side in a portion of terrain overlooking highway 97. One rider climbed high on the slope gaining a wind-exposed ridge above a rock band.

The rider triggered a large avalanche, approximately 800 metres wide by 400 metres long. The crown was 55cm deep on the steep, rocky, windswept roll where the avalanche was triggered, but significantly more snow was involved at lower elevations where the snowpack was sheltered from wind and much deeper. The bed surface was a crust that formed in early November and the suspected failure layer was faceted grains on the crust.

The snowmobiler was caught in the avalanche and buried in a terrain trap near the base of the slide. Their partner, who was watching from below and was not caught by the avalanche, performed companion rescue to locate and dig out the victim.

A third was turning around with the intention of providing assistance, when he also became stuck. The fourth member assisted the third by pulling on the ski of the snowmobile. The stuck snowmobile moved forward under heavy throttle and with the ski pill assistance by about 6 to 10 ft.  Right at this point, the third and fourth group members were both struck and fully buried by an avalanche from the slope above. The third member, who was still on his snowmobile, braced himself against the handlebars and managed to stay in an upright position. His head was uncovered relatively quickly by the two companions who were not buried. He claimed to have a small air pocket between his visor and his goggles. The fourth was more deeply buried face down in the snow. Once the head of the third member had been uncovered and it had been established he was still alive (he was dug out slightly later on by a member of another party) the rescuers started to search for the fourth member. By the time the fourth member was uncovered he was unresponsive. CPR was administered for 20-30 mins without success.","Revelstoke, Boulder Mountain",BC,50.99879837,-118.3279037,1650,Snowmobiling,2,0,1,February,6
42,64,2013-03-24,2013,Friday,"Around 2 pm on March 24, 2013 a party of three began a ski descent down a south west slope below Sifton Col.  It was initially a cold day, becoming milder in the afternoon, with clear skies and light winds. Two members of the group remained at the top of the slope, while one member skied down to assess conditions.  The skier triggered a size 2.5 slab avalanche, was engulfed by the avalanche and carried down the slope into a depression.  He was buried under approximately 1.5 m of debris.

The two remaining party members performed a companion rescue and uncovered their unresponsive partner.  CPR was initiated immediately while the patient was moved to a safer location, less exposed to avalanche danger.  One person stayed on scene and continued CPR while the second person skied back to the Rogers Pass Discovery Centre to report the incident.
